{\bf Common Lemmas:}
\newline \newline
{\bf (1)} If $f: X \to Y$ is a continuious function between metric spaces $(X,d)$ and $(Y,\varrho)$ then $f(X)$ is bounded.
\begin{proof}
Assume towards a contradiction that $f(X)$ is not bounded.  Therefore, for a fixed $y\in f(X)$ we have that for every $R$ there is some $f(x)$ such that $\varrho(y, f(x)) > R$.  Therefore we can construct some sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ such that $\varrho(f(x_n), y) > n$.  Since $X$ is compact there must be some $(x_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ with $x_{n_k} \to x_0 \, (\in X)$.  Since $f$ is continuous, we have that $f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x_0) \, (\in Y)$.  Since these sequences are covergent, it must be that $\varrho(f(x_{n_k}) ,y) \to \varrho(f(x_0) , y)$.  However, $\varrho(x_{n_k} , y) > n_k > k$ for all $k$.  This is a contradiction and therefore $f(X)$ is bounded.
\end{proof}
$\newline$
{\bf (2)} If $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ with $X$ compact, then $f$ must achieve a maximum and minimum value.
\begin{proof}
It suffices to show only $f$ achieving a maximum since the cases are the same.  Applying the first lemma we know that $f(X)$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$.  Therefore $\alpha := \sup f(X)$ exists.  Since $\alpha$ is the supremum of the range of $f$ for every $\epsilon$ there must be some $x$ such that $\alpha - \epsilon < f(x) \leq \alpha$.  Letting $\epsilon_n := \frac{1}{n}$ we can construct a sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ with $f(x_n) \to \alpha$.  Also since $X$ is compact there must be some $(x_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ with $x_{n_k} \to x_0 \, (\in X)$.  Since $f(x_n)$ is convergent, its subsequences must also be convergent to the same limit.  And by the continuity of $f$ we have:
$$ f(x_0) \leftarrow f (x_{n_k}) \to \alpha $$
By the uniqueness of limits $f(x_0) = \alpha$ is a maximum. 
\end{proof}

{\bf Problems:} \newline
{\bf (1)} For $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ with $X$ compact and $\forall x \in X \ \ f(x) > 0$ , then there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \in X \ \ f(x) \geq \delta$
\begin{proof}
By applying lemma 2 we know that $f$ must achieve a minimum for some $x_0 \in X$ and by hypothesis we know that $f(x_0) > 0$.  Therefore we can pick $\delta := f(x_0)$ and we know that for all $x \in X \ \ f(x) \geq f(x_0) = \delta$.
\end{proof}
$\newline$
{\bf (2)} For a set compact subset $K$ and $F$ a closed subset of some metric space $(X,d)$.  Show that if $K\cap F = \emptyset$ then there exists some $\delta >0$ such that:
$$ \forall p \in K \ \ \forall q \in F \ \ d(p,q) \geq \delta  $$
\begin{proof}
Assume towards a contradiction that for all $\delta > 0$ there exists some $p\in K$ and $q \in F$ such that $d(p,q) < \delta$.  Letting $\delta_n := \frac{1}{n}$ for any $n$ we can construct a sequences $(p_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $K$ and $(q_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in F such that:
$$ d(p_n,q_n) \to 0 $$
Since $p_n$ is a sequence in a compact set there must exist some subsequence $(p_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ that is convergent to some $p_0 \in K$.  I claim that the sequence given by $(q_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ is convergent to $p_0$.
$$ d(q_{n_k}, p_0) \leq d(q_{n_k}, p_{n_k}) + d(p_{n_k}, p_0) $$
and we can fix some $n_0$ where for all $n \geq n_0$:
$$ d(q_{n_k}, p_0) \leq d(q_{n_k}, p_{n_k}) + d(p_{n_k}, p_0) < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon $$
Since the sequence $q_{n_k}$ is convergent sequence in a closed set, its limit point is necessarily included in the set.  Therefore, $p_0 \in F$.  We can conlude that $\{ p_0 \} \subset F\cap K$ which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
\noindent I am confused here because I seem to have solved this problem without employing the strategy of {\bf (1)}.  My idea is that you could fix an element of $F$ and define a function the is the distance from the points in $K$ to the fixed element of $F$.  There is necessarily a positive mimimum of this function.  For each element of $F$ there is a fixed minimum value, and we could define another funcion on $F$ that ties these elements to their minimum distanced elements in $F$ and I would claim that this set has a minimum positive value in which case the question would follow but I don't kow how to prove the last step! \newline

{\bf(3)} Let $A$ be a non singular linear map $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ (an $n \times n$ matrix) show that there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that:
$$ ||A(x)|| = ||Ax|| \geq \delta ||x|| \ \ \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n$$
\begin{proof}
Note that since $A$ is nonsingular: $||Ax|| = 0 \iff ||x|| = 0$ since the only vector mapped to the 0 vector is the 0 vector.  Therefore we can fix the sphere of radius 1, denoted $S$.  This is compact since it is a closed and bounded susbset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Since $||x||$ and $||Ax||$ are nonzero for $x \in S$.  We can then define the function $f: S \to \mathbb{R}^n$ as follows:
$$ f(x) := \frac{||Ax||}{||x||} $$
This function is defined over a compact set and is positive for all $x \in S$.  Therefore, problem {\bf (1)} applies and there must exist some $\delta > 0 $ such that:
$$ f(x) = \frac{||Ax||}{||x||} \geq \delta \iff ||Ax|| \geq \delta||x|| \ \ \ \ (x\in S)$$
It remains to show the above for the rest of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Since this inequality holds trivially for the zero vector, fix some arbitrary non zero vector, $x$, in $\mathbb{R}^n$.  $x$ can be represented as $t\hat x$ with $\hat x$ a unit vector and $t \in \mathbb{R}$ nonzero.  Since $\hat x$ is a unit vector $\hat x \in S$ and we can write:
$$ ||A(x)|| = ||A(t\hat x)|| = t||A(\hat x)|| \geq t\delta||\hat x|| = \delta||x|| $$
$$ \iff ||Ax|| \geq \delta||x|| $$
Therefore the delta found for $S$ is sufficient for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{proof}  
$\newline$
{\bf (4)} Let $K$ and $F$ be compact and disjoint subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Show that there exists open sets $U$ and $V$ that contain $K$ and $F$, respectively, such that $U\cap V = \emptyset$
\begin{proof}
Since $K$ and $F$ are both compact sets we can apply the results of problem {\bf (2)} and find $\delta$ such that forall $k \in K$ and $f \in F$ it will be that $d(k,f) \geq \delta$.  By comactness we can also find finite $\delta/2$ dense sets in both $K$ and $F$.  More specifically, there exists:
$$ \{ k_0, k_1, \dots , k_n\} \subset K  \ \ {\rm and } \ \ \{ f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{\ell} \} \subset F $$
With the properties:
$$ \forall k \in K \ \ \exists i \leq n \ \ d(k, k_i) < \frac{\delta}{2} \ \ {\rm and } \ \ \forall f \in F \ \ \exists j \leq \ell \ \ d(f, f_j) < \frac{\delta}{2}$$ 
For each element of the $\delta/2$ coverings define the open sets:
$$ U_{k_i} := B\left(k_i, \frac{\delta}{2}\right) \ \  U_{f_j} := B\left(f_j, \frac{\delta}{2}\right) $$
Now define the open coverings of $K$ and $F$ as:
$$ U_K := \bigcup_{i=0}^n U_{k_i} \ \ {\rm and } \ \ U_F := \bigcup_{j=0}^{\ell} U_{f_j} $$
Clearly $K$ and $F$ are subsets of $U_K$ and $U_F$, respectively.  And $U_K$ and $U_F$ are both open as they are finite unions of open sets.  We must also have that $U_K \cap U_F = \emptyset$.  Otherwise there would exists some $x$ with $x \in U_K$ and $x \in U_F$ which would imply the existance of $k_i \in K$ and $f_j \in F$ such that:
$$ d(k_i,x) < \frac{\delta}{2} \ \ {\rm and } \ \ d(f_j, x) < \frac{\delta}{2} $$
$$ \Rightarrow d(k_i, f_j) \leq d(k_i, x) + d(x,f_j) < \delta $$
Which is a contradiction with $\delta$ being chosen such that every element in $K$ and $F$ are $\delta$ distance apart. 
\end{proof}

The next theme that is described in the collection is that taking limits gives items inside of compact sets!
\newline
{\bf (5)} If $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact, then there is a farthest point of $K$ to the origin.
\begin{proof} Begin by defining the set $A$ as follows:
$$ A := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \exists k \in K \ \ d({\bf0}, k) = x\} $$
Since $K$ is compact it is bounded, $A$ is also bounded above because of this fact.  Therefore we can define $\alpha := \sup A \,  (\in \mathbb{R})$.  We can also define a sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $A$ with $x_n \to \alpha$.  This sequence yields a sequence $(k_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $K$ such that $d(k_n, {\bf 0}) \to \alpha$.  Since $k_n$ is a sequence in a compact set there exists a futher subsequence $(k_{n_k})_{k=1}^\infty$ such that $k_{n_k} \to k_0 \, (\in K)$.  Since the distance metric is a continuous function and because of the properties of the sequence that $k_{n_k}$ is a subsequence of we have:
$$ d(k_0, {\bf 0}) \leftarrow d(k_{n_k}, {\bf 0}) \rightarrow \alpha $$ 
By the uniqueness of limits, $d(k_0, {\bf 0}) = \alpha$ and this is a maximal distance from the origin!
\end{proof}
$\newline$
{\bf (6)} For $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a compact set that is disjoint from a closed set $F$, then there is a closest point of $K$ to the set $F$.
\begin{proof}
By applying the result of problem {\bf (2)} we know that there is some $\delta > 0$ such that for all $k \in K$ and $f \in F \ \ d(k,f) \geq \delta $.  We can then define the set:
$$ A := \{ x \in \mathbb{R} : \exists k \in K \ \ \exists f \in F \ \ d(f,k) = x  \} $$
By the above, we know that $A$ is bounded below by some positive $\delta$.  Therefore $\beta := \inf A$ exists and is positive as well.  As before, we can fix sequences $(k_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ and $(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ such that $d(k_n,f_n) \to \beta$.  Since $(k_n)$ is a sequence in a compact set it omits a sequence $(k_{n_\ell})_{\ell = 1}^\infty$ which is convergent to some $k_0 \in K$.  We know that $d(k_{n_\ell}, f_{n_\ell}) \to \beta$.  It is also true that $d(k_0, f_{n_\ell}) \to \beta$ since:
$$ d(k_0 , f_{n_\ell}) - \beta \leq d(k_0, k_{n_\ell}) + d(k_{n_\ell}, f_{n_\ell}) - \beta < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \beta - \beta = \epsilon  $$
and:
$$ \beta - d(k_0, f_{n_\ell}) =  \beta  - (k_0, f_{n_\ell}) + d(k_0, k_{n_\ell})  - d(k_0, k_{n_\ell}) $$
$$ = \beta + d(k_0, k_{n_\ell}) - ((k_0, f_{n_\ell}) +d(k_0, k_{n_\ell}) ) \leq \beta + d(k_0, k_{n_\ell}) - d(k_{n_\ell}, f_{n_\ell}) $$
$$ < \beta + \frac{\epsilon}{2}  - (\beta - \frac{\epsilon}{2}) = \epsilon $$
Since $(f_{n_\ell})$ is within $\beta$ of $k_0$ in its limit then for some $N_0$ with $\ell \geq N_0$ the sequence $(f_{n_\ell})_{\ell \geq N_0}^\infty$ must be contained in the closed ball, $B$, of radius $2\beta$ around $k_0$.  Since $B$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ then it is compact and therefore $(f_{n_\ell})_{\ell \geq N_0}^\infty$ must have a convergent subsequence $f_{n_{\ell_g}} \to f_0$ but since this is also a sequence in $F$ which is closed $f_0$ must be contained in $F$.  I will now show that $d(k_0, f_0) = \beta$:
$$ d(k_0, f_0) - \beta \leq d(k_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) + d(f_{n_{\ell_g}}, f_0) - \beta$$
Since we know that $d(k_0, f_{n_{\ell}}) \to \beta$ we can write:
$$ \leq \beta + \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - \beta = \epsilon $$
Also:
$$ \beta - d(k_0, f_0) \leq \beta - d(k_0, f_0) - d(f_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) + d(f_0,f_{n_{\ell_g}}) $$
$$ = \beta + d(f_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) - (d(k_0, f_0) + d(f_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) \leq \beta + d(f_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) - d(k_0, f_{n_{\ell_g}}) $$
$$ < \beta + \frac{\epsilon}{2} - (\beta - \frac{\epsilon}{2}) = \epsilon $$
$$ |\beta - d(k_0, f_0)| < \epsilon \ \  \ \ \text{       for all } \epsilon >0 $$
$$ \iff \beta = d(k_0, f_0) $$
We have found points in $F$ and $K$ which are at a distance apart equal to the infimum of all the distances between K and F which is positive!
\end{proof} 
$\newline$
{\bf (7)} Let $X$ be a metric space and $f: X \to X$ be a contraction mapping.  Suppose that $K \subset X$ is a compact and nonempty set that satisfies $f(K) = K$.  Prove that $K$ contains one single point.
\begin{proof}
Note that since compact sets are bounded they have a finite diameter which is defined to be the supremum of all of the distances of all of the pairs of points in the set.  For a compact set $C$ this is denoted as $diam \, C$.  Also note that for a given compact set $C$ there exist points in $C$ which acieve this diamater.  Therefore if we assume that $K$ has more than one point there exists $x^*, y^* \in K$ such that $d(x^*, y^*) = diam\, K > 0$.  If we were to consider $f(K)$ we can easily show that this is compact.  
\newline
To do this fix some arbitrary sequence in $(y_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ n $f(K)$.  This induces some $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in $K$.  This has a convergent subsequence $x_{n_k} \to x_0 \in K$.  Since $f$ is a contraction mapping we know:
$$ f(f(x_0), f(x_{n_k})) \leq k d(x_0, x_{n_k}) \to 0 \ \ (k \in [0,1)) $$
$$ \Rightarrow y_{n_k}  = f(x_{n_k}) \to f(x_0) \in f(K) $$
Since $f(K)$ is also compact we can conclude that there must also be points $x^{**}, y^{**} \in f(K)$ such that $d(x^{**}, y^{**}) = diam \, f(K)$. Also there must exist $x_0, y_0 \in K$ for whice $x^{**} = f(x_0)$ and $y^{**} = f(y_0)$
$$d(x^{**}, y^{**}) =  d(f(x_0), f(y_0)) < d(x_0, y_0) \leq diam \, K $$
$$ \Rightarrow diam \, f(K) < diam \, K \Rightarrow  K \not= f(K) $$
Therefore, $K$ cannot have multiple points!
\end{proof}
